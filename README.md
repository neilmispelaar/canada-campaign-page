## Government of Canada Rules and Regs

The following are a list of Government of Canada rules and regulations that have to be followed when creating content for and publishing to the [Canada.ca](https://canada.ca) website: 

### Content and IA Specification

The Government of Canada has authored the [Content and IA Specification](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html) to help ensure a consistent user experience across all Canada.ca pages. 

The CIAS document has a [section](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/templates-detailed-specifications/campaign-pages.html) specifically for Campaign pages where you can find more details about the specification as well as examples of Campaign Pages.


### Canada.ca Content Style Guide

The [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html) documents the rules that must be used when creating and authoring web content that can be easily found, understood and used. They are based on writing principles and techniques that help make web content clear and adapted to the needs of all people.
