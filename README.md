## Preface

This README.md page was created to assist folks in the creation and design of Campaign Pages that go on Canada.ca. Help with building the actual pages are beyond the scope of this document. The objective is to provide the reader with a number of helpful resourses as well as take the reader through a series of steps to assist in the design process.


### What is a Campaign Page? 

Campaign pages are time-limited, promotional pages that respond to the Government of Canadaâ€™s desire to communicate, educate, influence, market, raise awareness and call to action.

These pages:
* allow for multi-channel or cross-channel marketing strategies that are centrally or institutionally funded (for example, print, television, radio, web, social media)
* enable the discovery of content that was created specifically for a GC advertising campaign, along with links to related program- or service-based content
* allow for greater visual design flexibility, while remaining connected to Canada.ca through navigation

Regardless the template variation applied, content on campaign page-sets or mini-sites should always point to the source Canada.ca program content in effective and compelling ways. This prevents confusion related to information authority and errors related to duplicate content.

## Designing Mockups

The following section takes the reader through some important prerequisites and then the steps that are recommended to design  the mockups for Campaign pages.   


### Prerequisites 

Before we start designing anything, it would be a good idea to review the literature written and adopted by the Government of Canada pertaining to Web content, design and implementation.

The section entitled [Web Guidelines for the Government of Canada](#web-guidelines-for-the-government-of-canada) has descriptions and links to all of the relevant documentation.

Emphasis should be placed on reviewing the [Content and IA Specification](#content-and-ia-specification) as well as the [Content Style Guide](#canadaca-content-style-guide) as these documents focus more on content, design and design patterns.  


### Step 1: Determine what header and footer you are using 

Review the section on [Template Variants](#template-variants) and determine if you are using either the Global Header and Footer or the Reduced Header and Footer. 


### Step 2: Determine if you want Breadcrumbs (Reduced Header and Footer only) 

If choose to use the Reduced Header and Footer, you may choose to either keep or remove the Breadcrumbs from the mockups. 

If you had chosen the Global Header and Footer in the previous step then you have to keep the Breadcrumbs and they have to be in your mockups. 


### Step 3: Review the different breakpoints on Canada.ca

Review the section on [Breakpoints](#breakpoints) to better understand the different viewports that need to be considered when designing content for the Campaign page. 

It is critical to provide creative direction for all viewports, so that the development teams know exactly how content should react in each viewport.

As an example, if you only create a mockup for Wide Screen Desktop, the development teams won't know how the designer intended for the content to react in a mobile or tablet environment.


### Step 4: Download Mockup Templates (Optional) 

PSD, PNG (and others?) templates are under construction...

(When Available) Download the templates that you prefer to work with...

#### Global Header

* Global Header - Extra small devices Phones (<768px) [PSD](/templates/global-header-mobile.psd) 
* Global Header - Small devices Tablets (=768px) [PSD](/templates/global-header-tablet.psd) 
* Global Header - Medium devices Desktops (=992px)
* Global Header - Large devices Desktops (=1200px)

#### Reduced Header

* Reduced Header - Extra small devices Phones (<768px) [PSD](/templates/reduced-header-mobile.psd) 
* Reduced Header - Small devices Tablets (=768px) [PSD](/templates/reduced-header-tablet.psd) 
* Reduced Header - Medium devices Desktops (=992px)
* Reduced Header - Large devices Desktops (=1200px)


These are only provided as a convenience, if you have your own template files or software that you prefer to work with please feel free to use those instead.

Please let us know if there are additional templates that you would like to see here.


### Step 5: Design 

Start designing!

When complete refer to the [checklist](#mockup-checklist) below prior. 

TO DO


## Mockup Checklist 

The following checklist is certainly not exhaustive, but contains a list of common issues or occurances that designers should be aware of:

- [ ] Design elements should not exceed the container width for each viewport (no full width designs)
- [ ] Contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colours for user interface components and graphic elements with important elements [WCAG 2.1 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/#1411-non-text-contrast-aa)
- [ ] Block capitals must be avoided, and italicised text can only be used to name acts or legislation 
- [ ] [Common design patterns](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/common-design-patterns.html) defined in the Content and IA Spec should be adhered to and not reinvented


## Resources 

### Web Guidelines for the Government of Canada

The following are a list of Government of Canada rules and regulations that have to be followed when creating content for and publishing to the [Canada.ca](https://canada.ca) website: 

#### Content and IA Specification

The Government of Canada has authored the [Content and IA Specification](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html) to help ensure a consistent user experience across all Canada.ca pages. 

The CIAS document has a [section](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/templates-detailed-specifications/campaign-pages.html) specifically for Campaign pages where you can find more details about the specification as well as examples of Campaign Pages.


#### Canada.ca Content Style Guide

The [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html) documents the rules that must be used when creating and authoring web content that can be easily found, understood and used. They are based on writing principles and techniques that help make web content clear and adapted to the needs of all people.


#### Web Standards for the Government of Canada

The [Government of Canada Standards on Web](http://tbs-sct.gc.ca/ws-nw/index-eng.asp) are a collection of policy vehicles that demonstrates the Government of Canada's commitment to delivering websites and applications that are more accessible, usable, interoperable and optimized for mobile devices. These Web Standards replace Common Look and Feel 2.0 (CLF 2.0) Standards for the Internet.

* [Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27088)
* [Standard on Web Interoperability](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25875)
* [Standard on Web Usability](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24227)
* [Standard on Web Accessibility](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601)


### Web Experience Toolkit 

Information about WET goes here 

WET Campaign Page Examples: 

* [WET Campaign Page Example 1](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/campaign-en.html)
* [WET Campaign Page Example 2](http://wet-boew.github.io/themes-dist/GCWeb/campaign2-en.html)


### Template Variants 

There are two versions of the header and footer that can be used when building a campaign page. 

* Global Header and Footer
* Reduced Header and Footer 

The "Global" version matches almost every other page on Canada.ca, while the "Reduced" version removes the main navigation elements as well as some footer elements which enables users to concentrate better on the content and the task at hand.
