## Government of Canada Rules and Regs

The following are a list of Government of Canada rules and regulations that have to be followed when creating content for and publishing to the [Canada.ca](https://canada.ca) website: 

### Content and IA Specification

The Government of Canada has authored the [Content and IA Specification](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html) to help ensure a consistent user experience across all Canada.ca pages. 

The CIAS document has a [section](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/templates-detailed-specifications/campaign-pages.html) specifically for Campaign pages where you can find more details about the specification as well as examples of Campaign Pages.


### Canada.ca Content Style Guide

The [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html) documents the rules that must be used when creating and authoring web content that can be easily found, understood and used. They are based on writing principles and techniques that help make web content clear and adapted to the needs of all people.


### Web Standards for the Government of Canada

The [Government of Canada Standards on Web](http://tbs-sct.gc.ca/ws-nw/index-eng.asp) are a collection of policy vehicles that demonstrates the Government of Canada's commitment to delivering websites and applications that are more accessible, usable, interoperable and optimized for mobile devices. These Web Standards replace Common Look and Feel 2.0 (CLF 2.0) Standards for the Internet.

* [Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27088)
* [Standard on Web Interoperability](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25875)
* [Standard on Web Usability](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=24227)

## Global Header and Footer 

There are two versions of the global header and footer that can be used when building a campaign page. 

* Global Header and Footer
* Reduced Header and Footer 

The "Global" version matches almost every other page on Canada.ca, while the "Reduced" version allows users to concentrate on the content and task at hand by removing the main navigation elements on the page.
